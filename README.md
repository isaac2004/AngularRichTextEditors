# AngularRichTextEditors
This repo includes samples for some Rich Text Editors that exist. They include

* [Markdown Based](https://github.com/dimpu/ngx-md)
* [NGX-Editor](https://github.com/Sibiraj-S/ngx-editor)
* [Froala](https://github.com/froala/angular-froala-wysiwyg)
* [Quill](https://github.com/KillerCodeMonkey/ngx-quill)
* [TinyMCE](https://github.com/siegerx3/angular-tinymce)
* [CKEditor](https://github.com/chymz/ng2-ckeditor)


While most of these modules were written in Angular 2.x, this repo is an Angular 5.x repo, so YMMV on functionality you need for each editor
